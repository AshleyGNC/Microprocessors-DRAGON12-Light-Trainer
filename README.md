# Microprocessors-DRAGON12-Light-Trainer
Project: Design a program that allows for user/hardware interaction. 

Singles Ping-Pong Game

Project Overview
Using the LED lights in the dragon board, a light will bounce within each boundary, and the player 
must hit the pushbuttons PH3 and PH0, for the left and right walls respectively, as soon as the 
light is visible in each boundary.
The game consists of three levels. The player will be able to access each level at the start of the 
program with the help of the DIP switches 1-3 (PH7-PH5). After each level, the program will 
restart for the user to pick a level again, no need to reset the dragon board unless the player wishes to 
quit playing. The score is kept and displayed in the seven-segment display at the end of the 
round. Scores are the hits on each wall counted throughout the round, the maximum score is 5 per 
level but the player can keep playing until he/she loses, and a score greater than 5 will not displayed.
The program prevents cheating.
